📺 Netflix Homepage – Static Frontend

This is a static frontend clone of the Netflix homepage, created using HTML and CSS.
The design is inspired by the original Netflix UI, focusing on layout, styling, and responsiveness (if added).
This project helped me practice web design, positioning, gradients, and UI structure.
